## Introduction

I started my PhD journey in Data Science at Maynooth University in
September 2022. I am being funded by the
[SFI Centre for Research Training (CRT) in Foundations of Data Science](https://www.data-science.ie/).
During the first year I have some mandatory modules and assignments concerning
the CRT program. Moreover, the CRT program supports the students to 
attend high-level training related to their specific background. 

One of the most important training in statistics is the
[Academy for PhD Training in Statistics (APTS)](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/apts/).
The APTS is a collaboration between major UK statistics research groups to
organize courses for first-year PhD students in statistics. Each year there 
are four intensive weeks in different universities. According to their
description:

> The intention of APTS is to provide courses which will be attractive and
relevant to the research preparation and background education of all statistics
and probability PhD students.

Besides the high-level courses taught by renowned professors, other advantage
to attend the APTS modules is the opportunity to meet first-year PhD students
from different universities across UK. This is fantastic!

This post aims to describe the first week modules I took in University of Warwick
during 13-16 December, 2022. I will give an overview of the topics covered and
in the next post I will provide the solution of one assignment.

## Courses

The first week was organized by the Department of Statistics from
[University of Warwick](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/).
We had an intensive week with two modules, namely
Statistical Computing and Statistical Inference, which were delivered by
professors [Darren Wilkinson](https://darrenjw.github.io/) from
Durham University and
[Simon Shaw](https://researchportal.bath.ac.uk/en/persons/simon-shaw/)
from University of Bath, respectively.


#### Statistical Inference

One interesting feature of APTS courses is the preliminary notes, which
help the students prepare for the module. The preliminary notes on Statistical
Inference course is available
[here](https://people.bath.ac.uk/masss/APTS/2022-23/IntroductoryNotes/) and
it covers the following:

- Introduce the idea of statistical models
- Motivate some principles of statistical inference
- Review the two statistical inference paradigm (Classical and Bayesian approaches)

The course main topics were: principles of inference,
decision theory, and confidence sets and hypothesis testing. 
Various key statistical concepts were discussed during the course and I would say
that the two books of David Cox, entitled
[Theoretical Statistics](https://link.springer.com/book/9780412124204) and
[Principles of Statistical Inference](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/principles-of-statistical-inference/BCD3734047D403DF5352EA58F41D3181)
broad most of them in full detail way.

It was quite attractive for me the second half of the course that compromised
the inference problem under a decision problem viewpoint.
Generally speaking, the decision making $d$ acts as an estimate of the
parameter $\theta$ and the specific problem loss function $L(\theta, d)$ 
measures the quality of $d$ when $\theta$ is known. 
We have seen that decision theory provides (i) a link between Bayesian and 
classical procedures, and (ii)
Bayesian explanations to inference questions addressed in the Classical approach.

In general, the course was very dense, covered several theoretical
key concepts, and provided to me an interesting vision about the decision
theory which I haven't studied yet..

The main notes and course assignment can be found
[here](https://people.bath.ac.uk/masss/APTS/2022-23/LectureNotes/) and [here](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/apts/students/resources/apts-si-assessment.pdf),
respectively.

#### Statistical Computing

This was my favorite course, I could review and learn many important concepts
and methods which I will use during my thesis. We mainly use R to perform the
computational calculations. Although the main emphasis were on the concepts and
not on R programming.
The emphasize given in matrix theory was genial and I could realize their
importance to compactly write and work with statistical models.

The [preliminary notes](https://darrenjw.github.io/work/teaching/apts-sc/pre/index.html)
was great, with some exercises that helped review statistics and mathematics
knowledge used during the module.

The three main topics of the course was: (i) Matrix computing, (ii) Optimization
and (iii) Calculus by computer (differentiation and integration).
The main notes can be found [here](https://darrenjw.github.io/work/teaching/apts-sc/notes/apts_statistical_com/index.html).
Darren Wilkinson didactic is unique and surprisingly, he can manage difficult
concepts in a very understandable and easily manner for the student.

We had two laboratory practical session. The
[first one](https://darrenjw.github.io/work/teaching/apts-sc/APTS-SC-Labs.pdf)
covered matrix computing exercises, which one of the exercises we should show
the equivalence of perform the principal components analysis (PCS) using
singular value decomposition (SVD) and the Eigendecomposition.
The [second lab session](https://darrenjw.github.io/work/teaching/apts-sc/APTS-SC-Labs2.pdf)
was primary about optimization and one interesting exercise we 
had to implement the maximum likelihood estimators of the linear mixed models.

To sum up, in the next post I will provide the solution of the statistical
computing assignment, which the exercises can be found
[here](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/apts/students/resources/starcomp-assessment2223.pdf). 
This assignment deal with most of the concepts discussed during the module.

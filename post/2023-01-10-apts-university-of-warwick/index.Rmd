## Introduction

I started my PhD journey in in Data Science at Maynooth University in
September, 2022. I am funded by the funded by
[SFI Centre for Research Training (CRT) in Foundations of Data Science](https://www.data-science.ie/).
During the first year I have some mandatory modules and assignments concerning
the CRT program. Besides that, the CRT the program supports the students to 
attend high-level training related to your specific background across the world. 

One of the most important training in statistics is the
[Academy for PhD Training in Statistics (APTS)](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/apts/).
The APTS is a collaboration between major UK statistics research groups to
organize courses for first-year PhD students in statistics. Each year there 
are three intensive weeks in different universities. According to their
description:

> The intention of APTS is to provide courses which will be attractive and
relevant to the research preparation and background education of all statistics
and probability PhD students.


Besides the high-level courses taught by renowned professors, other advantage
to attend the APTS modules is the opportunity to meet first-year PhD students
from different universities across UK.
This is fantastic!

This post aims to describe the first week modules I took in University of Warwick
during 13-16 December, 2022. I will give an overview of the topics covered and
in the next post I will provide the solution of one assignment.

## Courses Topics

The first week was organized by the Department of Statistics of
[University of Warwick](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/).
We had a intensive week with two modules, namely
Statistical Computing and Statistical Inference, which were delivered by
professors [Darren Wilkinson](https://darrenjw.github.io/) from
Durham University and
[Simon Shaw](https://researchportal.bath.ac.uk/en/persons/simon-shaw/)
from University of Bath, respectively.

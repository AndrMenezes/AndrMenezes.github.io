<div id="introduction" class="section level2">
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>I started my PhD journey in Data Science at Maynooth University in
September 2022. I am being funded by the
<a href="https://www.data-science.ie/">SFI Centre for Research Training (CRT) in Foundations of Data Science</a>.
During the first year I have some mandatory modules and assignments concerning
the CRT program. Moreover, the CRT program supports the students to
attend high-level training related to their specific background.</p>
<p>One of the most important training in statistics is the
<a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/apts/">Academy for PhD Training in Statistics (APTS)</a>.
The APTS is a collaboration between major UK statistics research groups to
organize courses for first-year PhD students in statistics. Each year there
are four intensive weeks in different universities. According to their
description:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The intention of APTS is to provide courses which will be attractive and
relevant to the research preparation and background education of all statistics
and probability PhD students.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Besides the high-level courses taught by renowned professors, other advantage
to attend the APTS modules is the opportunity to meet first-year PhD students
from different universities across UK. This is fantastic!</p>
<p>This post aims to describe the first week modules I took in University of Warwick
during 13-16 December, 2022. I will give an overview of the topics covered and
in the next post I will provide the solution of one assignment.</p>
</div>
<div id="courses" class="section level2">
<h2>Courses</h2>
<p>The first week was organized by the Department of Statistics from
<a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/">University of Warwick</a>.
We had an intensive week with two modules, namely
Statistical Computing and Statistical Inference, which were delivered by
professors <a href="https://darrenjw.github.io/">Darren Wilkinson</a> from
Durham University and
<a href="https://researchportal.bath.ac.uk/en/persons/simon-shaw/">Simon Shaw</a>
from University of Bath, respectively.</p>
<div id="statistical-inference" class="section level4">
<h4>Statistical Inference</h4>
<p>One interesting feature of APTS courses is the preliminary notes, which
help the students prepare for the module. The preliminary notes on Statistical
Inference course is available
<a href="https://people.bath.ac.uk/masss/APTS/2022-23/IntroductoryNotes/">here</a> and
it covers the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Introduce the idea of statistical models</li>
<li>Motivate some principles of statistical inference</li>
<li>Review the two statistical inference paradigm (Classical and Bayesian approaches)</li>
</ul>
<p>The course main topics were: principles of inference,
decision theory, and confidence sets and hypothesis testing.
Various key statistical concepts were discussed during the course and I would say
that the two books of David Cox, entitled
<a href="https://link.springer.com/book/9780412124204">Theoretical Statistics</a> and
<a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/principles-of-statistical-inference/BCD3734047D403DF5352EA58F41D3181">Principles of Statistical Inference</a>
broad most of them in full detail way.</p>
<p>It was quite attractive for me the second half of the course that compromised
the inference problem under a decision problem viewpoint.
Generally speaking, the decision making <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> acts as an estimate of the
parameter <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> and the specific problem loss function <span class="math inline">\(L(\theta, d)\)</span>
measures the quality of <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> when <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> is known.
We have seen that decision theory provides (i) a link between Bayesian and
classical procedures, and (ii)
Bayesian explanations to inference questions addressed in the Classical approach.</p>
<p>In general, the course was very dense, covered several theoretical
key concepts, and provided to me an interesting vision about the decision
theory which I haven’t studied yet..</p>
<p>The main notes and course assignment can be found
<a href="https://people.bath.ac.uk/masss/APTS/2022-23/LectureNotes/">here</a> and <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/apts/students/resources/apts-si-assessment.pdf">here</a>,
respectively.</p>
</div>
<div id="statistical-computing" class="section level4">
<h4>Statistical Computing</h4>
<p>This was my favorite course, I could review and learn many important concepts
and methods which I will use during my thesis. We mainly use R to perform the
computational calculations. Although the main emphasis were on the concepts and
not on R programming.
The emphasize given in matrix theory was genial and I could realize their
importance to compactly write and work with statistical models.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://darrenjw.github.io/work/teaching/apts-sc/pre/index.html">preliminary notes</a>
was great, with some exercises that helped review statistics and mathematics
knowledge used during the module.</p>
<p>The three main topics of the course was: (i) Matrix computing, (ii) Optimization
and (iii) Calculus by computer (differentiation and integration).
The main notes can be found <a href="https://darrenjw.github.io/work/teaching/apts-sc/notes/apts_statistical_com/index.html">here</a>.
Darren Wilkinson didactic is unique and surprisingly, he can manage difficult
concepts in a very understandable and easily manner for the student.</p>
<p>We had two laboratory practical session. The
<a href="https://darrenjw.github.io/work/teaching/apts-sc/APTS-SC-Labs.pdf">first one</a>
covered matrix computing exercises, which one of the exercises we should show
the equivalence of perform the principal components analysis (PCS) using
singular value decomposition (SVD) and the Eigendecomposition.
The <a href="https://darrenjw.github.io/work/teaching/apts-sc/APTS-SC-Labs2.pdf">second lab session</a>
was primary about optimization and one interesting exercise we
had to implement the maximum likelihood estimators of the linear mixed models.</p>
<p>To sum up, in the next post I will provide the solution of the statistical
computing assignment, which the exercises can be found
<a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/apts/students/resources/starcomp-assessment2223.pdf">here</a>.
This assignment deal with most of the concepts discussed during the module.</p>

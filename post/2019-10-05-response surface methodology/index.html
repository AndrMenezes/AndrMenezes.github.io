<h2>Concepts</h2>
<p>When a researcher has control about the experiment and her/his interest is to determine
the experimental region that optimizes the response variable, the response surface methodology
is a very suitable statistical technique for this task.</p>
<p>Formally introduced by George P. Box and K. B. Wilson in 1951, the response surface models
assume that the relationship between the factors <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{x} = (x_1, \ldots, x_p)\)</span>
(fixed) and the response variable <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{y}\)</span> (random) is described by a linear model,
defined by
<span class="math display">\[\boldsymbol{y} = f(\boldsymbol{x}) + \boldsymbol{\varepsilon}\]</span>
where the true function <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is usually unknown and <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}\)</span> is called
random term, i.e., it represents other sources of variability that could not controlled in the
experiment.</p>
<div id="the-functional-form" class="section level3">
<h3>The functional form</h3>
<p>In most application the true relationship between <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{y}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{x}\)</span>
is unknown. Hence, Taylor approximations on <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> are considered.
The most simple approximation, for instance, is the first order Taylor expansion.
Due to its simplicity, it is common the first order model to have lack of fit concerns,
especially when the experimental region presents some curvature.
In such cases, approximations of higher order are required.
In general, second order models are sufficient to describe the surface.</p>
<p>Another relevant aspect to determine the functional form of the model is data collection,
that is, the experimental design.
The desirable properties of a design are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Rotatability:</strong>
when the same quantity of information about response surface in the same distance <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> is
independently of direction in relation to the central point of experiment.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Orthogonality:</strong> when the linear, interaction, quadratic, or higher order of the model are independent.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>With the design established and the appropriate model fitted, the next step is to determine
the optimal region or walk towards and optimal region.
For this, mathematical techniques to determine and characterize the optimal region are used.</p>

<h2>Illustrative example</h2>
<p>Consider the experiment involving a procedure for storing bovine semen, which the main
goal is to evaluate the effectiveness of this procedure.
The experimental conditions are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(x_1\)</span>: percentage additions of sodium citrate,</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(x_2\)</span>: glycerol percentage, and</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(x_3\)</span>: the equilibrium time in hours before freezing with a temperature maintained at 5ºC.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The response variable, <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, is the percentage of surviving sperm.</p>
<p>For data collection, the researches adopted the <span class="math inline">\(2^3\)</span> central composite design with
central and axial points <span class="math inline">\(\alpha = 2\)</span> without replications.</p>
<p>The final model chosen to describe the experiment is given by
<span class="math display">\[\widehat{y} = 57.769 -1.312\,z_1 -2.312\,z_2 + 9.125\, z_1\, z_2 -9.048\,z^2_{1} -11.423\,z^2_{2}\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(z_i = \frac{x_i - m_i }{h_i}\)</span> is the factor <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> encoded in <span class="math inline">\(-1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>, with <span class="math inline">\(m_i\)</span> denotes the
mean between highest and lowest observed value of the factor <span class="math inline">\(x_i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(h_i\)</span> is half
the difference between highest and lowest observed value.</p>
<p>To study the experimental region we write the final model in canonical form
<span class="math display">\[\widehat{y} = 58.06 - 5.520\,w^2_{1} - 14.948\,w^2_{2}\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(w_1 = -0.791(z_1 + 0.155) - 0.612(z_2 + 0.163)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(w_2 = - 0.612(z_1 + 0.155) + 0.791(z_2 + 0.163)\)</span>.</p>
<p>The two eigenvalues are negatives, then the critical point é local maximum, where
<span class="math inline">\((z_1,z_2) = (-0.155,-0.163)\)</span> or in the original scale of the factors
<span class="math inline">\((x_1,x_2) = (2.891,7.511)\)</span>.</p>

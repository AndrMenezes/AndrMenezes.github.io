## Overview

The last course I had to do was another seminar minister by professor 
[Luis K. Hotta](https://scholar.google.com.br/citations?user=itj-WrUAAAAJ&hl=en). 
Since it was in COVID-19 period this seminar was online. In the first part,
we read and summarized three online presentations chosen by the professor.
While in the last part, we elaborated two presentations. The former
presentation was a class with topics for master degree level, and the latter
was about an article. Besides that, we had to do a report on the
classmates' seminar.

## Course assignments

In the first presentation my topic was quantile regression. Quantile regression
was introduced by [Koenker and Basset (1978)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1913643). This
model can be view as an extension on linear regression when the interest lies
on estimate the impact of explanatory variable on the entire distribution of
the response variable not only on the mean response.
Particularly, the goal is estimate the $\tau$-quantile of $Y$ given the
covariates $\mathbf{x}$, i.e.,
$$
Q_\tau(Y \mid \mathbf{x}) = \mathbf{x}_i\,\boldsymbol{\beta}(\tau)
$$
My complete [presentation](/pdf/quantile_regression__presentation.pdf)
(in Portuguese) contains further details about quantile regression, estimation,
inference (frequentist and Bayesian), and extensions.

The second presentation I chose the paper
["FFORMA: Feature-based forecast model averaging"](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0169207019300895) by 
Montero-Manso, P., Athanasopoulos, G., Hyndman, R. J. and Talagala, T. S.
In this work, the authors proposed a method for computing weighted forecasts
from different methods using time series features. 
The full presentation (in Portuguese) can be found [here](fforma__presentation.pdf).
My main criticism about the method is related to the computational effort,
according to the authors the model spent 5 days in order to fit 100.000 of
time series from M4 competition.

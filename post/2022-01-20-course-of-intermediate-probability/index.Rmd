## The fundamental of Statistics

Probability theory is a branch of pure mathematics crucial for statistics.
In fact, probability theory provides a rigor mathematical description of statistical
tools. Usual statistical inference results such as frequentist properties of
estimators, maximum likelihood inference and Bayesian inference have their roots in
probability theory. 

At advanced probability course student learns the measure theory and the classical book
[Probability and Measure](https://www.amazon.com.br/Probability-Measure-Patrick-Billingsley/dp/0471007102) of the probability theorist and actor
[Patrick Billingsley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Billingsley) is one primary
reference.

In a more elementary level the measure theory is not addressed and no knowledge
beyond elementary calculus is presumed.
This restrictions of mathematical knowledge is necessary costly since more technical
details are omitted, the generality of some theorems reduced,
make statements without proof, and cumbersome
arguments is sometimes have to be used.
All these scarifies, however, is inhibit the importance of the course rather less than
one might suppose. The essential aspects of theory is entirely comprehensible without
higher mathematics. 


## Course contents

In my Master's Degree I had an intermediate course of probability theory. The textbook was ["Probability: An Intermediate Level Course"](https://impa.br/page-livros/probabilidade-um-curso-em-nivel-intermediario/) by Barry Ree James (in memorial).
The course was taught by professor
[Diego Fernando de Bernardini](https://scholar.google.com.br/citations?user=8XKVbggAAAAJ&hl=pt-BR), who literally copied the book on board.
During the course I organized some notes with the course contents and can be find [here](/pdf/probability_notes_master_degree.pdf) (in Portuguese).

The course was organized in the following major themes:

- Basic definitions

- Random variable and distribution functions

- Mathematical expectation

- Conditional distribution and expectation

- Law of large numbers

- Convergence in distribution

- Central Limit Theorem


## Exams

At the end of the course I spent one month studying all the contents and solving a lot of
exercises in order to prepare myself for the probability exam. I remembered to solve the
all exercises of the previous exams and reviewed several probability exercises from
Barry James book. I studied hard.

My probability exam can be find [here](pdf/probability_exam.pdf) (in Portuguese).

## Introduction

The regression models are a fundamental tool for every data analyst.
Several natural and anthropogenic phenomena can be describe by regression models.predictions
In general, this happen when the goal is to investigate a relationship between a response
variable and others variables (covariates), then from this established relationship obtains
predictions.

When the response variable in bounded on the unit interval $(0, 1)$ the linear regression
model under normal random errors is not appropriate anymore.
A widely used solution consists of carrying out some transformation in the response variable
so that it assumes values in the set of $\mathbb{R}$. 
However, such transformation compromises the interpretation of model parameters in the 
original scale of the response variable, beside that, the predicted values can extrapolate
the limits of unit interval.


## Main Models

In view of this limitation some authors have introduced alternative model so that the
assumptions used are consistent with the reality of the phenomena.
A class of models that have been received attention are the parametric regression models
for bounded response. In this models, the assumption is that the response variable conditional
to the covariates follows some probability distribution with support on $(0, 1)$

The construction to this models is similar to the [Generalized Linear Models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_linear_model),
but the stochastic component does not belong to the [exponential family of distributions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_family),
a fact that occurs in the GLMs and provide more greater computational ease for
parameter estimation, which was crucial in the 70s and 80s.


Certainly, the most well known probability distribution with support on $(0, 1)$ is the
Beta family of distributions.
In the 2000s, both [Cepeda-Cuervo (2001)](/pdf/cepeda-cuervo.pdf) in his doctoral thesis, and 
[Ferrari e Cribari-Neto (2004)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0266476042000214501)
in a scientific paper, introduced a parametrization of Beta distribution such that 
the parameters denote the mean and the precision of response variable.
For this model the probability density function is defined by

\begin{equation}\label{eq:pdf-beta}
f(y \mid \mu,\phi) = \dfrac{\Gamma(\phi)}{\Gamma(\mu\,\phi)\Gamma((1-\mu)\,\phi)}y^{\mu\phi-1}(1-y)^{(1-\mu)\phi-1} I_{(0, 1)}(y)
\end{equation}
where $\mu \in (0,1)$ denotes the mean, $\phi>0$ is the precision parameter, and
$\Gamma(\cdot)$ is the [gamma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_function) function.


Following this paraemtrization the Beta regression model assumes that
$Y_i \sim \text{Beta}(\mu_i, \phi_i) , i = 1, \ldots, n,$ in such way that 
the mean and precision parameters are defined, respectively, by
\begin{equation}\label{eq:link}
g(\mu_i)	 = \mathbf{x}_i^\top\,\mathbf{\beta} \quad \mathrm{e} \quad
h(\phi_i)	 = \mathbf{z}_i^\top\,\mathbf{\gamma}
\end{equation}
where 
$\mathbf{\beta} = (\beta_0, \ldots, \beta_{p-1})^\top$ and $\mathbf{\gamma} = (\gamma_0, \ldots, \gamma_{k-1})^\top$
are the parameter vectors associated with the mean and precision, respectively;
$\mathbf{x}_i$ and $\mathbf{z}_i$ 
are covariates vectors associated with the mean and precision of the model for the
$i$-th observation, respectively; $g(\cdot)$ and $h(\cdot)$ are
appropriates link functions.

The link functions must be twice differentiate with relation to the parameters.
The link function for $g(\cdot)$ must satisfies $(0, 1) \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$,
thus usual choices are

- $\mathrm{logit}$: $g(\mu_i) = \log\left(\mu_i / (1-\mu_i)\right)$;

- $\mathrm{probit}$: $g(\mu_i) = \Phi^{-1}(\mu_i)$, where $\Phi^{-1}(\cdot)$ is the quantile function of standard Normal distribution;

- $\mathrm{c}\log$-$\log$: $g(\mu_i) = \log\left[-\log(1-\mu_i)\right]$.

The $h(\cdot)$ link function must satisfies $\mathbb{R}^{+} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$,
two usual functions are the logarithm and square root functions.

In the 90s the Norwegian statistician [Bent Jorgensen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bent_J%C3%B8rgensen_(statistician))
extended the GLMs with the dispersion models. This class of models includes the Simplex
distribution introduced in [Barndorff-Nielsen e Jorgensen (1991)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0047259X9190008P),
which is an interesting alternative to the Beta distrbution.
Its probability distribution function is given by

$$
f(y\mid \mu, \phi) = \left[2\pi\phi^2\{y (1-y)\}^3\right]^{-1/2} \exp\left\{-\dfrac{1}{2 \phi^2} \left[\dfrac{(y - \mu)^2}{y (1 - y) \mu^2(1-\mu)^2}\right]\right\}I_{(0, 1)}(y)
$$
where $\mu \in (0, 1)$ denotes the mean and e $\phi >0$ is the dispersion parameter.

The Simplex regression model follows a similar structure to the Beta model, where the parameters $\mu$ and $\phi$
they relate to the predictors through the appropriate binding functions $g(\cdot)$ and $h(\cdot)$. 


## Final considerations

Under the parametric statistics paradigm several regression models for bounded response
have been proposed in the literature. Such model can present regression structure for the mean,
precision or even the shape of the distribution.
Furthermore, there are model that seek to obtain a complete view of the response variable
condition on covariates by means of the quantiles, i.e., the interest parameter that is
related with the covariate is some quantile.

In the last two year with a partnership with my advisor, professor  [Josmar Mazucheli](http://lattes.cnpq.br/8899185212821611),
we have published some papers that introduced alternative probability distribution 
for modeling bounded phenomenas.
The works are as follows:

- unit-Weibull distribution [1](/pdf/2018-unit-weibull.pdf) [2](/pdf/2018-unit-weibull-regression.pdf);
- [unit-Lindley](/pdf/2018-unit-lindley) distribution;
- [unit-Gaussiana](/pdf/2018-unit-inverse-gaussian) distribution;
- [unit-Gompertz](/pdf/2019-unit-gompertz) distribution;
- [unit-Birnbaum-Saunders](/pdf/2018-unit-bs) distribution.
